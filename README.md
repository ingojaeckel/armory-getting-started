# armory-getting-started

This is an example project to demonstrate how you could build & deploy [armory](https://github.com/ingojaeckel/armory) to your AWS environment. Just customize the AWS configuration in `deploy-armory.sh` and `my_configuration.go` and run `./deploy-armory.sh`. This project comes with a [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines) configuration that allows you to build & run your customized version of armory (see `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`).
